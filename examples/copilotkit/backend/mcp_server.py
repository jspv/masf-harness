"""A tiny self-contained stdio MCP server for the CopilotKit example.

It exposes one tool, ``sales_rows(region)``, that returns a full year of daily
rows — deliberately large and structured so the harness's spill middleware turns
the return into a typed handle (instead of flooding the model's context). The
agent then writes ``run_python`` to load that handle and compute the answer.

Run standalone (the example backend launches it for you over stdio):
    uv run python examples/copilotkit/backend/mcp_server.py
