      <h1>harness × CopilotKit</h1>
      <p>
        The chat sidebar on the right talks to the harness AG-UI backend, which has a
        <code> sales </code> MCP server wired in. Try asking:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“What was total EU revenue in 2025, excluding invalid rows?”</li>
        <li>“Compare EU vs NA revenue for 2025 and show the gap.”</li>
        <li>“Which region had the most invalid rows?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Behind the scenes the agent calls the MCP tool, the large result is spilled to a
        typed handle, and the agent writes sandboxed Python to compute the answer — you
        see its progress stream in the chat.
      </p>
