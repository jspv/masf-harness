"""Tool status updates: a tether-owned side-band channel.

A tool calls ``report_progress(...)`` while it runs; the call routes through a
``contextvars`` lookup to the ``StatusBus`` the active ``Session`` bound for this run, which
fans the event out to subscribers (e.g. a ``Tether(on_status=...)`` callback or the CLI
``--verbose`` printer). Outside a bound run, ``report_progress`` is a no-op, so tools can
call it unconditionally. This is a side-band channel: mid-tool and MCP progress are not part
of MAF's response stream (which carries text deltas and tool-call lifecycle), so the tether
delivers them itself.
